  # GK: First, We print user name along with the micropost. To avoid
  # "N+1 queries" problem, we eagerly load post.user. Second, the
  # following method call results in two SQL queries. They need to be
  # wrapped inside a transaction to avoid showing "Nil" in place of
  # user name. Third, we need to either make transaction execute
  # lazily, or make the two queries execute eagerly. I don't know how
  # to do the former, so I did later using `load`.
